# 1.0.0
## Added
- this `CHANGELOG.md`
- Men's Basketball and Football support
- _much_ simpler application compared to both GitHub Pages version and version where I had to manually update a `games.ts` file with every game ID and time of the game

## Removed
- `dist` directory, since Heroku will just build it now with the redeploy
